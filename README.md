Material for [AWRA2022](https://www.awra.org/Members/Events_and_Education/Events/2022_GIS_Conference/2022_GWTC_Workshops.aspx)
Geospatial R and Python Workshop.

## Intro Material

Loosly based on [Introduction of Geoinformatics](https://mikejohnson51.github.io/spds/)

 - [Data Type and Structure](https://mhweber.github.io/AWRA2022GeoWorkshop/session1)

 - [Data Manipulation](https://mhweber.github.io/AWRA2022GeoWorkshop/session2)

 - [Vector Data 101](https://mhweber.github.io/AWRA2022GeoWorkshop/session3)

## Getting Started

For working with R, you can use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and you will
need the following libraries installed:

```r
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(knitr)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(stringr)
library(osmdata)
library(mapview)
library(dataRetrieval)
library(terra)
library(stars)
library(remotes)
library(elevatr)
install_github("mhweber/awra2020spatial")
library(awra2020spatial)
install_github("mhweber/Rspatialworkshop")
library(Rspatialworkshop)
```

For running Python notebooks you can use a combination of
[Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) and your favorite
IDE such as VS Code or Jupyter Lab. For example, you can install it on OSX
as follows:

```bash
APP_DIR="~/.local/apps" && \
wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-MacOSX-x86_64.sh && \
chmod +x Mambaforge-MacOSX-x86_64.sh && \
bash ./Mambaforge-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -b -p ${APP_DIR}/mambaforge && \
rm -f Mambaforge-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

where `APP_DIR` can be set to any location of interest.

After installing `mambaforge` you can create a Python environment as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mhweber/AWRA2022GeoWorkshop && \
cd AWRA2022GeoWorkshop && \
mamba env create -f environment.yml
```

Now a new environment called `awra2022` is created that can be loaded from your IDE.
You can also use the Binder service by clicking on the Binder badge to launch a Jupyter Lab
instance with all the required Python libraries installed.
